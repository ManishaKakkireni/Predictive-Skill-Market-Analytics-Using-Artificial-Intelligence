**Predictive Skill Market Analytics Using Artificial Intelligence**

📌 Overview
Predictive Skill Market Analytics Using Artificial Intelligence is a full‑stack AI-powered system that analyzes developer survey data to evaluate:
-> Skill Demand Score
-> Average Salary Trends
-> Most Valuable Skills
-> Market Insights for Future Career Decisions
The system helps students, job seekers, and professionals make data-driven career decisions using real-world market analytics.

🎯 **Problem Statement**
Choosing the right technical skill is difficult because:
Market demand changes rapidly
Salary trends are unclear
